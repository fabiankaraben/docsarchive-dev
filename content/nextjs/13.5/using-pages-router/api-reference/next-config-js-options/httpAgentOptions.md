# httpAgentOptions

In Node.js versions prior to 18, Next.js automatically polyfills `fetch()` with [undici](/nextjs/13.5/using-app-router/architecture/supported-browsers#polyfills) and enables [HTTP Keep-Alive â†—](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Keep-Alive) by default.

To disable HTTP Keep-Alive for all `fetch()` calls on the server-side, open `next.config.js` and add the `httpAgentOptions` config:


next.config.js
```
module.exports = {
  httpAgentOptions: {
    keepAlive: false,
  },
}
```
